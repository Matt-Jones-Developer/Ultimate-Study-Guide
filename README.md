# ultimate-study-guide

## An updated version of my Study Guide, inspired by the pre-work challenge.

- Added more complex html, css and some basic js to enchance the webpage.
- Added a bio (scary horror pic!) and a few skills and goals I wish to achieve during this course.

- I haven't finished the layout, refactored the code, or finished this project yet.
- included a dev-todo.txt for detailed todo and updating notes.
