// a place for all the development ideas, todos and more! (I probably should use 'issues' in GitHub)

TODO:

# Add the custom styled JS 'to do list' code 
# DONE: Create a custom CSS stylesheet for the todo
# Verify that it's allowed by the tutor!

# add animations - fade in title footer - slide in containers etc 
# Add all the topics that we have discussed so far - rewrite the notes and provide more info on each topic
# Add handy links to W3Schools to quickly work on anything I need to improve on, or practice

# Develop a way to 'accordian' open/close each section's container - to stop the webpage getting too long.


# Add anything else that is required to pass the assignment
